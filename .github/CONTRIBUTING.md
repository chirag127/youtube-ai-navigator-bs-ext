## 🚀 Setting Up Your Development Environment

To get started with local development:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
    - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (our preferred package manager)
    - A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/chirag127/YouTube-AI-Navigator-Browser-Extension.git
    cd YouTube-AI-Navigator-Browser-Extension

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    bash
    pnpm install

4.  **Start development server:**
    This command will build the extension and watch for changes, automatically reloading the extension in your browser after modifications.
    bash
    pnpm dev

    Follow the instructions provided by WXT to load the unpacked extension in your browser.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Technologies

This project adheres to a **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

**Key Technologies:**

- **TypeScript 6.x (Strict Mode):** For robust, type-safe code.
- **WXT Framework:** Powers our browser extension development, offering excellent developer experience and build performance.
- **Vite 7 (via WXT):** For lightning-fast development builds and optimized production bundles.
- **TailwindCSS v4 (JIT Mode):** For utility-first styling (if applicable, or general CSS practices).
- **Biome:** Our chosen linter and formatter for superior performance and code consistency.
- **Vitest:** For fast unit and integration testing.
- **Playwright:** For robust end-to-end (E2E) testing of browser interactions.

## ✍️ Coding Guidelines

To ensure code quality and consistency:

- **TypeScript First:** Write all new code in TypeScript, leveraging its type system extensively.
- **Feature-Sliced Design:** Organize your code according to FSD principles (e.g., `src/features`, `src/entities`, `src/shared`).
- **Biome:** All code must pass Biome linting and formatting checks. Your PR will fail CI if these checks do not pass.
  bash
  pnpm run lint # Checks for linting errors
  pnpm run format # Auto-formats code
  pnpm run check # Runs lint, format, and type checks
- **SOLID, DRY, YAGNI:** Adhere to fundamental software engineering principles.
- **Clear & Concise Code:** Write readable code with meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
- **Security Minded:** Always consider potential security implications, especially when handling user data or external APIs.

## ✅ Testing

Comprehensive testing is a cornerstone of this project.

- **Unit/Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  bash
  pnpm test:unit

  Write tests for new features and bug fixes to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. Aim for high code coverage.

- **End-to-End Tests (Playwright):**
  bash
  pnpm test:e2e

  For critical user flows and browser interactions, contribute to our Playwright test suite.
